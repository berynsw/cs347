The epsilon value is set at the top of jacobi_iterator.c
Typing make in the main folder, will produce 3 executables, 
jacobi_speedup_test, jacobi_barrier_test, and diff_check. 

The difference between speedup test and barrier test is matrix size and 
partition strategy which required pre-processor defines.
diff_check takes two matrix file paths as args and calculates
their max difference.


Here is an example of a jacobi_speedup_test run:
./jacobi_speedup_test --barrier 0 --input input.mtx --output output --subtasks 7

Here is an example of a jacobi_barrier_test run:
./jacobi_barrier_test --barrier 1 --input input.mtx --output output --subtasks 256

ARGS     
--barrier:  0 is sem heap, 1 is cond barrier, 2 is pthread barrier
--input:    the input file path of course
--output:   output file path
--subtasks: number of child threads 
            (only powers of 2 for barrier test, all natural numbers for speedup test)
Note: all args are required (sorry)

Outut Format: number of iterations,real-time elapsed(seconds),cpu-time elapsed(seconds)
Note: there is no newline at the end of each output so that we could control them with 
a running script. Running the script runs all the tests. 
The script assumes that data is contained in a folder called data_ref.
