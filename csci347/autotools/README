The error we saw in class was from building a distribution from a non-clean
build environment.   I ran `make check` before `make checkdist`.  When you build
the distribution, execute `make clean` first.

Remember that you need to add the following to the configure script to
boot-strap ls on your test VM.

if [ -f /bin/.ls ]
then
  alias ls=.ls
fi

Here is a quick tutorial on vi.  I didn't know about the ZZ command.  You
probably only need section 2 and parts of 3.
